# FastGPT: A Lightweight ChatGPT Implementation Using FastHTML

**FastGPT** is a minimalistic ChatGPT implementation built using FastHTML, designed to be fast and lightweight, while providing a seamless experience for users. It connects to the GPT-4o model and supports session-based memory to allow for back-and-forth interactions.

We aim to progressively and iteratively add features to better align with the current state of ChatGPT. This project is open-source, so feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request or forking the repo and building upon it yourself!

- **Session Management**: Refreshing the page or pressing the "New Chat" button will terminate the current session and initiate a fresh one.
- **Automatic Markdown Parsing**: Both the home page and model responses support Markdown, allowing for easy formatting and enhanced readability.
- **Dynamic Input Box**: The chat input dynamically grows for better visibility when entering long messages.
- **Lightweight Design**: Built without front-end frameworks, leveraging vanilla CSS for a lightweight, fast user experience.
- **Token-by-Token Streaming**: Responses from the model stream onto the screen in real-time, providing instant feedback.
- **Interaction Management**: Users cannot send a message while the model is still generating a response, ensuring a smooth interaction.
- **"New Chat" Button**: Easily initiate a new session with a simple button click.
